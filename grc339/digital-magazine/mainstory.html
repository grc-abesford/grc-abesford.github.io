            <h2>Worn wear: Fashion rehab with Simon Ungless</h2>
            <p>After years shaping some of fashion’s most iconic looks alongside Alexander McQueen, Simon Ungless has settled into a very different rhythm on the California coast. But the change in pace hasn’t dulled his edge—instead, it’s sharpened his focus. Trading catwalks for coastal studios, Ungless now channels his creative energy into work that feels deeply personal, experimental, and environmentally grounded.</p>
            <p>Ungless’s current practice blends fine art and fashion, but not in the expected ways. He works with reclaimed fabrics, naturally dyed materials, and found objects—items often discarded or overlooked. Each garment is a layered composition, infused with texture and history. Rather than hide the imperfections of age or wear, Ungless highlights them, treating fabric like canvas and memory like thread.
            </p>


            
            <p>Sustainability isn’t a marketing tactic in Ungless’s work—it’s a philosophy. His approach critiques fast fashion not through slogans but through process. Each piece is slow-made and unrepeatable, resisting mass production in both method and meaning. In doing so, Ungless invites viewers and wearers to consider how clothing can carry stories, not just styles.Much of his recent output pushes the boundary between wearable art and sculptural form. Some pieces drape like cloaks; others feel like fragments of landscapes or old photographs, sewn into being. There’s a tactile poetry to them, rooted in emotion and place. Here, the natural world and human experience aren’t separate—they're woven together.

            <p>In a culture that favors the new, the pristine, and the mass-made, Ungless makes a quiet but radical statement: that beauty endures in what’s weathered, that value can be redefined through care, and that the future of fashion might just lie in what we choose not to throw away.
            </p>

            <p>Ungless’s journey into fashion began not on the runway, but in the print room. Originally trained as a textile designer, he developed an early obsession with process—screen printing, dyeing, layering—which has never left him. Even at McQueen, where spectacle often reigned, Ungless was the quiet force behind many of the label’s most intricate surface treatments and fabric manipulations. His deep knowledge of materials helped shape the gritty romanticism that defined McQueen’s early collections.

            <p>Ungless’s work today is almost entirely divorced from commercial cycles. He doesn’t release seasonal collections or sell in boutiques. Instead, his pieces are made in small batches or as one-offs, often exhibited in galleries or worn by collaborators. His studio practice is quiet and reflective—a far cry from the frenzy of fashion week. “I’m not interested in producing more things,” he says. “I’m interested in making things that matter.”
